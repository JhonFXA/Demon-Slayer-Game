## About:
This is a game project I'm working on for fun, inspired by the anime *Demon Slayer* and its game *Demon Slayer Hinokami Chronicles*. 

There are still many things to add to make it a good game, but I'm working on it gradually in my free time :).
I started developing this game after watching this video by **ChrisCourses** (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyqbNFMDRGQ&t=12578s&ab_channel=ChrisCourses" target="_blank">Click here to watch!</a>) on how to make a fighting game with **JavaScript** and **HTML Canvas**. Since then, I have been following this tutorial and adding more things to improve it.
